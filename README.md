# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TanStack Router**. It's a work in progress designed to showcase the skills I’ve learned and what I’m currently learning as I transition into a front-end / full-stack development role.

## Pages

- **Home** – A short intro and link to 'About' page.
- **About** – My background and current toolkit.
- **Projects** – Planned to showcase projects I've built or contributed to (coming soon).

This README will be updated as the project evolves.
