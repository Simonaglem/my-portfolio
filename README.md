# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TanStack Router**. It's a work in progress designed to showcase the skills I’ve learned and what I’m currently learning as I transition into a front-end / full-stack development role.

This README will be updated as the project evolves.
